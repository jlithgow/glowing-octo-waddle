(1) Generated image.
> Use THREE.js framework for ease of development.
> Create 3d grid of points (random from variable range)
> Create shape class
--> made up of box frame, cross frame joints, and an inside circle.
--> all random colors (from selection pallate)
--> all random size (random from variable range)
> populate point grid with shapes
> position camera and lighting (required for three.js)
--> TODO: check if THREE has generic toon/flat shader preset.
> set parameters and render scene.

(2) Generated Texture
> --Author probably used something like substance designer or another material creation software.--
> I would use processing(for vector version) or THREE as a framework.
> Create X amount of base layers, each starts a recursive loop
> if a layer has more then X amount of area uncovered create a new layer
--> new layer is random shape made from points that move in an 8 angle direction until it intersects with itself
--> TODO: fine-tune filters for the walker to create some more repetative movements like in the picture
--> new layer has random height increase (from range).
-> Map color to height of layer (each layer gets a random ranged value to offset color variable)
> position camera and lighting (required for three.js)
--> TODO: check if THREE has generic toon/flat shader preset.
> set parameters and render scene.
